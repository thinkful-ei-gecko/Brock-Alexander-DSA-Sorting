1a. It will grab the first items in the array and sort them, then grab the second two items in the aray and sort them,
 then third step would be to merge those two smaller arrays into a new sorted array. [ 1, 21, 26, 45 ] would be output after 3 recursive calls

1b. After the 16th call the data is full sorted.

1c. [ 21, 1 ] [ 26, 45 ] are the first two arrays to be merged together.

1d. [ 43, 34 ] would be the list being merged on the 7th step.

2a. The pivot could have been either 14 or 17

2b.
